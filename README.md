# Wholesale Data Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook, `wholesale_data_analysis.ipynb`, is designed to perform a comprehensive analysis of wholesale data for a fictional e-commerce company. It covers data exploration, transformation, and analysis to address real-world business questions such as identifying top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more.

## Functionality
The notebook is structured into four main parts:

1. **Explore the Data:** This section imports the dataset, examines the structure of the data, and answers preliminary questions to understand the distribution and nature of the data.

2. **Transform the Data:** Here, the data is manipulated to better suit analysis needs. This includes creating new columns for subtotals, shipping prices, total prices, costs, and profits.

3. **Confirm Your Work:** This part of the notebook verifies the accuracy of the data transformations by comparing calculated totals against known values provide by the challenge.

4. **Summarize and Analyze:** The final section uses the transformed and verified data to extract meaningful insights, focusing on the performance of the top 5 clients by quantity and providing a summary of findings.
